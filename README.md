# Draven Monti
I am a fifteen year old developer. My primary focus is on learning about the world around me: this translates in the development world to algorithms and experimental proofs of concept.

Because I am autistic, my interests are narrow, and I struggle in a social environment. *However, this does not and will not block my progress in development.*

## Interests
In general, I have interests in the following:
- Abstract mathematics: [metamath](https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html), calculus, [googology](https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/Googology_Wiki)
- Applied mathematics: **computer science**, deep learning
- Writing: **Wikipedia articles**
- Politics: global history, ideologies

Bolded entries indicate areas I've also contributed to in some form, in addition to passive consumption.
